# Reinforcement Learning: All Actions Optimization

This reinforcement learning (RL) project seeked to implement, test, and compare a new, novel RL algorithm to a traditional
RL algorithm similar to One Step TD learning.

The complete paper is available [here]()

## Motivation

Existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods can be costly to train agents, both in regards to money and time.
Even training an agent in a simple environment like Atari Breakout can take millions of timesteps to achieve humanlike performance.
Due to these costs, it remains an open problem within DRL and finding more efficient methods of training is highly desirable.
